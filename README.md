# terraform-azurerm-alz

At the moment this repo demonstrates potential v.next configurations for the ALZ Terraform module.
We have adopted a more modular approach and we hope we have addressed key asks, such as the ability to fully customise the management group hierarchy.

The ALZ module proposal is focussed on management groups and policies, with separate modules being created for networking and management.

The new proposed architecture contains two items:

1. A new *provider* to perform the necessary data processing for policies, role assignments and management groups.
2. A new lightweight *module*, which takes the outputs of the provider and then deploys the resources using standard Azure providers (AzureRM/AzAPI).

None of these items exist yet! But we would like to show you how they could work to get feedback ðŸ˜ƒ

We have provided three directories as examples:

- [Deploying ALZ defaults](https://github.com/Azure/terraform-azurerm-alz/blob/main/alz-defaults)
- [Customizing management groups](https://github.com/Azure/terraform-azurerm-alz/tree/main/customizing-mgs)
- [Provider details](https://github.com/Azure/terraform-azurerm-alz/tree/main/provider)
